# NutriCam

An app that uses the Clarifai API to identify food you have taken a picture of, uses the WolframAlpha API to retrieve nutrition information, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning to determine if it is healthy or not.

Note that you may need to provide your own API keys and URLs for some portions of the app to run if you want to compile it yourself.
